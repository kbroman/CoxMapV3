## Build 39 positions of markers in Cox map

- [`MouseMapConverterCoords.Rmd`](MouseMapConverterCoords.Rmd) - R
  Markdown document from Dan Gatti to get build 39 positions for the
  markers in the Cox genetic map

- [`mouse_map_conv_new_positions.csv`](mouse_map_conv_new_positions.csv) -
  positions of markers in the Cox genetic map in build 37, 38, and 39.
  There are 12 markers with missing build 39 position. There is an
  inversion on chr 14 in build 39 vs build 37/38, and one on chr 10 in
  build 38/39 vs build 37.
