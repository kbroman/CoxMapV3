## Cox original maps

- [`combinedmaps_2008-08-06_clean.csv`](combinedmaps_2008-08-06_clean.csv) -
  original file with build 34 and build 37 positions, the original
  Shifman et al. positions, and the Cox et al. positions
  (10,202 markers, including 7 with "multiple mappings" and so no
  build 37 position)

- [`snpmap_rev_2008-12-10.csv`](snpmap_rev_2008-12-10.csv) - original
  Cox et al. map with positions shifted so that 0 Mbp (build 37) == 0 cM
  (10,184 markers plus the zero position for each chromosome; the 11
  missing markers have non-standard names like "petM-09011-1" and
  "jfTRP") Note that chr X is listed as chr 20.

- [`CoxMaps_rev_build38.csv`](CoxMaps_rev_build38.csv) - original Cox
  et al. map with build 38 positions included. There is one missing
  build 38 position on chr 18 (rs6377403). Chr 10 has an inversion at
  the centromere in build 38 relative to build 37
  (3.1 Mbp - 7.0 Mbp in build 37; 7.3 Mbp - 3.3 Mbp in build 38)
